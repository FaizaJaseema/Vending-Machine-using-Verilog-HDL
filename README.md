Built a Vending Machine Controller using Verilog HDL

Designed a Finite State Machine (FSM) to simulate a vending machine.Implemented coin detection, balance calculation, item dispensing, and change return logic.Verified functionality through testbenches and simulations (ModelSim/Quartus) to ensure correct operation.
